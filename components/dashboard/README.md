# Dashboard Component Architecture

This folder contains the refactored dashboard component, broken down into smaller, well-organized pieces for better maintainability and code organization.

## File Structure

```
dashboard/
├── index.ts                      # Main export file for all dashboard components
├── dashboard-main.tsx            # Main dashboard component that orchestrates everything
├── dashboard-header.tsx          # Header component with title and actions
├── dashboard-stats-cards.tsx     # Statistics cards component
├── dashboard-charts.tsx          # Chart components (bar chart and pie chart)
├── dashboard-recent-projects.tsx # Recent projects list component
├── dashboard-upcoming-tasks.tsx  # Upcoming tasks component
├── dashboard-utils.ts            # Utility functions (styling, formatting, throttling)
├── dashboard-analytics.ts        # Analytics and statistics calculation hooks
├── dashboard-chart-data.ts       # Chart data processing hooks
└── dashboard-task-management.ts  # Task management logic hooks
```

## Component Responsibilities

### `dashboard-main.tsx`
- Main orchestrator component
- Handles state management
- Coordinates between sub-components
- Manages data fetching and refresh logic

### `dashboard-header.tsx`
- Renders the dashboard header with icon and title
- Contains refresh button and project creation modal
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### `dashboard-stats-cards.tsx`
- Displays the four main statistics cards
- Shows total projects, active projects, overdue tasks, and team members
- Responsive grid layout

### `dashboard-charts.tsx`
- Renders both project progress bar chart and status distribution pie chart
- Includes legends and tooltips
- Responsive chart containers

### `dashboard-recent-projects.tsx`
- Shows list of recent projects with progress bars
- Includes edit and delete actions
- Project status badges and task completion tracking

### `dashboard-upcoming-tasks.tsx`
- Displays upcoming and overdue tasks
- Urgency-based sorting and badges
- Task filtering and prioritization

## Utility Files

### `dashboard-utils.ts`
- Color utility functions for status badges
- Date formatting functions
- Throttling utility for performance
- Shared styling helpers

### `dashboard-analytics.ts`
- Custom hook for calculating project analytics
- Statistics computation (completion rates, progress tracking)
- Performance-optimized with useMemo

### `dashboard-chart-data.ts`
- Chart data processing and transformation
- Project progress data for bar charts
- Status distribution data for pie charts

### `dashboard-task-management.ts`
- Task filtering and sorting logic
- Upcoming task calculations
- Task urgency badge logic

## Usage

The main dashboard component can be imported directly:

```tsx
import { Dashboard } from '@/components/dashboard'
```

Individual components can also be imported for reuse:

```tsx
import { 
  DashboardHeader, 
  DashboardStatsCards,
  DashboardCharts 
} from '@/components/dashboard'
```

## Key Features Maintained

- All original functionality preserved
- Exact same UI and UX
- Same performance optimizations
- TanStack Query integration
- Responsive design
- Real-time data updates
- Error handling and loading states

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify individual pieces
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Performance**: Logic is separated from UI components
6. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
7. **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and understand the codebase

This refactoring maintains 100% compatibility with the existing codebase while providing a much cleaner and more organized structure for future development.
